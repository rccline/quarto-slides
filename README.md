Quarto Slide Templates 

This repository currently hosts two slide templates which have been created from the following YouTube presentations:  

1. *quarto-presentation-slides.qmd* slide document was created using Andrew Gard's  presentation [*Beautiful presentations with R and Quarto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01KifhHDkFk) on his *Equitable Equations* YouTube channel.  

2. *quarto-revealjs-slidedeck.qmd* slide document was created using 
*Posit PBC*' presentation [*Get Started with Quarto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew&t=980s) by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel

Both videos walk through the creation of presenting slide presentations using quarto.  

The purpose of this repository is to create personal templates to guide myself through slide presentations using Quarto using the [RStudio Visual Editor](quarto.org).
