  abstract = {In this learning experience, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel -- Professor of the Practice of Statistical Science at Duke University -- will introduce you to Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. Through discussion and live demos, she will share how she uses Quarto for creating reproducible, computational documents, from course notes to journal publications to books and web pages. Familiarity with R and RStudio will be helpful for following along with the demos, however, those who work with any computational documents in any language (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks with Python) will also find the content relevant, particularly since Quarto is language-agnostic and can be used to create dynamic content with any computing language.}
